The `dataset01.csv` and `dataset02.csv` consists of 27000 entries.

For project, we have filtered the dataset for year 1990-2014, country as USA, language as English for which we get 
10060 entries.


## Project Implementation Steps:

1. Run the `filteringDataset.ipynb` to filter the dataset and remove duplicate IDâ€™s. After executing we get 
`datasetWithoutBoxOffice.csv`.

2. Run `extractBoxOffice.ipynb` to extract box office using WebCrawl class present in `webcrawl.py`. After executing we get `datasetWithBoxOffice.csv`.

**Optional(but suggested):** We have made 10 copies of `extractBoxOffice.ipynb` with 1000 entries each, and then using `mergeCSV.ipynb` we have merged all the csv's to get `datasetWithBoxOffice.csv`.

> Alternatively, you can run `extractBoxOfficeAllEntries.ipynb` to extract box office for all entries, but consumes lot of time (in hrs).

3. Run `extractTicketInflationPrice.ipynb` to extract table of ticket inflation price by year. After executing we get `ticketPriceInflation.csv`.

4. Run `adjustTicketPriceInflation.ipynb`. After executing we get `finalDataset.csv`.

5. Run `plotDataset1.ipynb`, `plotDataset2.ipynb` to visualise the dataset.

**For Windows when converting to csv use encoding as UTF-8.**
